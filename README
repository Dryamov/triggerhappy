- a lightweight hotkey daemon -

Triggerhappy is a hotkey daemon developed with small and embedded systems in
mind, e.g. linux based routers. It consists of the small C program "keyread"
that reads from an input device file and decodes any key, button or switch
events received. The decoded event data is then written to STDOUT.

The triggerhappy daemon itself is a small shell script that reads the data
generated by readkey and takes action upon receiving a key press event; it
starts to look for commands associated with that specific button code in its
and configured script directory executes them.
