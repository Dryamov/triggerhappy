Triggerhappy is a hotkey daemon developed with small and embedded systems in
mind, e.g. linux based routers. It attaches to the input device files and
interprets the event data received and executes scripts placed in its
configuration directory.

Examples:

Dump all events received through two device files:

	thd -d /dev/input/event0 /dev/input/event1

Read from /dev/input/event0 and launch scripts from /etc/triggerhappy/:

	thd -s /etc/triggerhappy/ /dev/input/event0

The daemon launches scripts that correspond to event name received; On pressing
the Enter key, thd launches /etc/triggerhappy/KEY_ENTER if present.
